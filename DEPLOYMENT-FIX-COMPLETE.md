## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, your Vercel deployment should:

- ✅ **No 404 errors** on missing packages
- ✅ **No ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE** errors
- ✅ **No missing export** errors from modules
- ✅ **No NextAuth import** errors
- ✅ **No TypeScript compilation** errors
- ✅ **Successful build** and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Run the fix script: `bash scripts/fix-lockfile-complete.sh`
2. Commit all changes
3. Push to main branch
4. Redeploy on Vercel with cache cleared
5. Verify deployment success

## Cleanup After Success

Once deployment is successful, you can:
- Remove the temporary `vercel.json` override
- Gradually re-enable strict TypeScript settings
- Replace type shims with proper interfaces
- Enhance component implementations as needed
